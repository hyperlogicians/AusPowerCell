You are building the frontend of a React Native app using Expo.  
Use **TailwindCSS with NativeWind** and **shadcn/ui components for React Native** to create modern, smooth, iOS-level UI.  
Prioritize **tablet-first design** (Samsung tablets), then mobile second.  
The UI must look polished like Tuya Smart app or iOS Home app, with smooth animations, optimistic updates, and clean layout.  
The app should use a **light theme** with a **linear gradient background (#516679 → #B3BAC0, top to bottom)** across all pages.  
Do not generate backend code—only frontend screens, navigation, and components.  

**App Name:** AusPowerCell – Valves Control App  

**Pages to build:**  

1. **Login / Signup Page**  
   - Clean iOS-style forms  
   - Gradient background  
   - Modern shadcn input fields + buttons  
   - Smooth transitions  

2. **Main Dashboard**  
   - List of valves with online/offline status  
   - Show valve details: state, metrics  
   - Controls: Open / Close / % slider  
   - Show queued commands (if Wi-Fi drops), with optimistic UI and rollback states  
   - Alerts (offline, travel timeout, mismatch) displayed as banners/cards  
   - Local notifications support  
   - Tablet-optimized grid layout  

3. **Audit Logs Page**  
   - List of logs: who did what, when, and result  
   - Timeline-style UI with shadcn components  

4. **Users Page**  
   - Show users, last login time, and activity  
   - Card-based layout, iOS look  

5. **Settings Page**  
   - Units, Quiet Hours, etc.  
   - No internet required  
   - Switches, toggles, and segmented controls styled like iOS  

**Additional requirements:**  
- Use **Expo Router** for navigation.  
- Keep the code modular with reusable UI components (e.g., ValveCard, AlertBanner, LogItem).  
- Add smooth transitions/animations (Framer Motion for React Native or Reanimated).  
- Ensure everything matches modern iOS UX patterns, with accessibility in mind.  
- Optimize layouts for tablets first, but responsive to mobile.  

Generate all pages, navigation, and reusable components in a clean project structure.
